I developed an online examination system using Java Swing, entirely without a database. 


Project: Online Examination System

Key Features:

Online Portal for Exams: A user-friendly interface where users can take exams consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions.

Immediate Score Card: After submitting the test, users receive their scores instantly, ensuring quick feedback.

Bookmark Functionality: Users can bookmark any question during the exam to revisit and modify their answers before final submission.

No Database Required: The entire system operates without a database, relying on in-memory data handling, which simplifies deployment and maintenance.



This project was both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to think creatively about data management and user experience.
